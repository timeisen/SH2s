# SH2s
The code in this repo is a collection of helper scripts that generate a library of SH2 domains used in the manuscript (Eisen et al., 2025). 

The SH2 domains come either from the PFAM database or from ancestral sequences reconstruction. 

The code to generate this library is written in a combination of several languages and uses both publicly available tools (e.g. PASTA and CODEML) and custom scripts. A full description of each step is included in this repo as a markdown of a jupyter notebook: "GenerateSH2sV5.pdf"
